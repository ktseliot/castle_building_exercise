# Castle Construction Exercise
A Git exercise that involves the creation of a castle.

## Purpose of this Exercise
* Git Branching Practice
* Git Merging Practice
* GitHub Pull Requests

## Instructions
1. Clone down this git respository.
2. Checkout to the `develop` branch.
3. Create your own feature branch and name it according to the castle section that you've been appointed to construct.
4. Open `castle_structure.txt` -- this is where you'll construct/draw the castle in.
5. Make a Pull Request to the `develop` branch from your own feature branch once you're done constructing your castle section.
6. Once a Pull Request has been merged into `develop` (*the person responsible for merging in a Pull Request should notify everyone in the team asap*), switch back to your `develop` branch and pull in the latest changes from `origin develop` into your local `develop` branch.
7. Always merge in the latest changes from the `develop` branch into your own feature branch -- resolve any merge conflicts if there are any.
8. Once the team has finalised the **ENTIRE** castle structure in the `develop` branch, merge the `develop` branch into `master` and tag the merge as `v1`.

> ⚠️ **NEVER** work on the `master` branch -- **MAKE SURE** you're on your feature branch when making huge changes.
>
> ⚠️ **NEVER** make a Pull Request from your feature branch into `master`.
> 
> ⚠️ **NEVER** merge in stuff from your feature branch into `master`.
>
> **ALWAYS** keep your local `develop` branch up-to-date with the remote `develop` branch

## Optional Deliverable
* After the `v1` version of the castle has been deployed, work on improving the castle.

> Create a feature branch for the amendments then make a Pull Request into the `develop` branch once you're finished.

## Castle Engineers
